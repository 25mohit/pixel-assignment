**I developed an interactive canvas where users can add, delete, and manage provider nodes with unique constraints. Key functionalities include:**

1. I have provided a dropdown from which userc can add Providers Node.

2. Each Node only be added when it's Unique.

3. There is a Delete Button "X" in every Node to Delete that articular Node.

4. Drag and Drop functionality where user can drag and drop Nodes anywhere inside the Canvas area smoothly.

5. User can Zoom In and Out the Canvas for better viewing experience.

6. Validation while adding Nodes, if user tyring to add same Node then a error will show up.

7. Displaying relevant data of nodes, such as Amount.

8. User can add a Node and and connect edge from "Payment Initialize" Node to that "Payment Provider" Node, and remove that edge.

9. Added functionality to save current React-Flow Data to localStorage, and when user come back then that saved Flow will be rendered.

10. Added functionality to remove saved data in localStorage.

11. Added Validation, so that user can't added same "Payment Provider" node multiple time.

12. Added Feature to export flow data in Excel Format for future use.

### `Note: There is a Feature Requirement in Assignment that, user can able to Redo and Undo the Tasks, but for that I didn't have Paid React-Flow NPM Package. That Feature only available in Paid React-Flow NPM Package.`
